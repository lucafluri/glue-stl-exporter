STL and OBJ Exporter for glue
---------------------

This plugin provides an STL and OBJ exporting functionality.

One can import e.g. a 3D fits data set, then open a "3D Volume Rendering" view. After enabling this plugin,
that view will have an additional button for exporting and creating an stl file of the 3d data.

It will create separate files for separate layers and separate subsets for each layer, naming them accordingly.


This plugin is currently work-in-progress. We appreciate feedback via GitHub if errors are encountered, so we
will be able to address them as soon as possible.
